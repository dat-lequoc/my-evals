ok, I want you synthesize all the info and data. So I traveled with a friend, and I paid everything things. we need to check the account and see how much he needs to refund me. you're given: 1. the transactions (may be there're missing, if you suspect something is missing, feel free to make a block "?" so I can check manually later on and add them. There're some transactions only for me, or only for my friend. Default, we split 50-50. 2. index is our plan. we didn't do exactly that, but 90% match though. you can base on the info to guess / make sense the transaction finally, make an new html to display, where you list exact transactions, and put them 50-50 by default (like share you know), I can toggle if it's on me or on my friend. - I should be able to add items / transaction too (e.g another hotel was paid by another card) - show the sum he needs to pay , needed info etc ...
